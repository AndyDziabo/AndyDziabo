 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Andy's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   Many years ago I attended Purdue University where I studied Computer Graphics, specifically Computer Animation. I learned about animation, 3D modeling, along with both raster and vector graphics. In my time there I also took some web design and programming classes which I found that I really enjoyed. After graduating I struggled to find work in the animation field, and soon found a job at a fairly new power plant as an operator in the coal yard. Then family and life came in. The job was a good job that supported my family, and I enjoyed the work so I stuck with it. I was learning new skills such as welding, and industrial equipment repair but I always thought back to my college years and how much I enjoyed the web design and coding I had been exposed to. I decided it was time for a change and to go back to the thing I had gotten a taste for all those years ago. But being out of it for almost 20 years I knew that I would need to start fresh and chose to get a jump start back into the world of web development. I applied to Flatiron School and was accepted into the Software Engineering program. It was an amazing experience, starting with front-end development, then tackling back-end development, and finally doing full-stack development projects. I learned so much in such a short time, and met so many amazing people. Now having completed the program I am continuing my journey to learn as much as I can to keep my skill set growing.
